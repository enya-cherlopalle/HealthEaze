<h3 id="c">C</h3>
<p><strong>Cost sharing:</strong> a general term to describe the amount you must pay for your healthcare and appointments after you have reached your deductible. The main two are co pays and co insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Co-pay:</strong> this is a fixed amount you must pay per appointment after you have reached your deductible
    - This amount is different for different services
    - It is determined by the insurance plan and should be clearly written out in your plan paperwork</p>

<p><strong>Co-insurance:</strong> this is a percentage of the cost of an appointment you must pay after you have reached your deductible
    - Usually having co-pays is better for you than co-insurance, since the cost of healthcare appointments gets very expensive, and if you are paying a percentage of that (ie, 10%) you are typically paying more than if you were paying a fixed co-pay (ie, $30)</p>

<h2 id="section-d"><a id="section-d"></a>Section D</h2>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3 id="d">D</h3>
<p><strong>Deductible:</strong> how much you must pay out of pocket before your insurance pays ANYTHING
    - For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible, you will pay for every part of your healthcare costs until you have spent $1,000. Once you have reached the deductible, your insurance will begin to pay some of your healthcare costs (this proportion depends on your insurance, explained later)
    - If you have a low premium but a high deductible you need to take into account that until you have spent the sum of your premium and deductible, your insurance is not paying for anything.</p>

<h2 id="section-h"><a id="section-h"></a>Section H</h2>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3 id="h">H</h3>
<p><strong>HMO</strong>
    - Typically a lower premium but higher deductible. Therefore you will have higher out of pocket expenses before you will get any coverage
    - NO out of network coverage. You must stay in network to get your care covered. This means it is important when picking a HMO to see that the providers you plan to visit are in network. Also take note of ER or Urgen cares that are close to you that are in network. 
    - If you want to see a specialist ( anyone other than a primary care provider) you must get a referral from your primary care provider.
    - Good if you rarely see providers and are able to only see in network providers.</p>
<h2 id="section-i"><a id="section-i"></a>Section I</h2>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3 id="i">I</h3>
<p><strong>In network:</strong> the specific set of providers that your insurance plan collaborates with, meaning they are preferred by your insurance
    - You want to use in network services as much as possible since it is cheaper for you. When picking an insurance plan, you want to make sure that the providers convenient for you are in network to avoid paying out of network costs.</p>

<h2 id="section-o"><a id="section-o"></a>Section O</h2>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3 id="o">O</h3>
<p><strong>Out of network:</strong> providers that do not have a deal with your insurance, therefore cost you more money to visit. 
        - Some plans cover out of network providers, just with less financial support to you as they do in network providers. 
        - This does not include providers that are simply not covered by your insurance at all. Typically plans that do partially cover out of network providers will differentiate between out of network providers and providers/services that are not covered at all.</p>

<p><strong>Out of pocket maximum:</strong> This is the maximum amount you will pay for your healthcare on top of your premium. This includes all co pays, co insurance payments, and deductibles. 
    - Once you get to the out of pocket maximum, you will not need to pay for any of your services ( so no co-pays or co-insurance)
    - There are typically different thresholds for an out of pocket maximum for in network and out of network costs. Therefore for all in network costs you need to reach the in network threshold to hae in network costs covered, while you must separately reach the out of network threshold to have all out of network costs covered. 
    - <strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> if you use or have paid for services that are not covered by your insurance at all (this does not mean that they are just out of network, this means they are not covered at all in or out of network) you still must pay for them completely. These costs do not count towards your out of pocket maximum.</p>

<h2 id="section-p"><a id="section-p"></a>Section P</h2>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3 id="p">P</h3>
<p><strong>Premium:</strong> yearly cost you must pay just to have the insurance ( be a cardholding member)
<strong>PPO</strong>
    - Typically a higher premium but a lower deductible. Therefore you will have a high upfront cost but then get insurance coverage sooner. 
    - Has out of network coverage. Though often more expensive than in network, you will not have to pay for it completely out of pocket (unless you havent reached your deductible, like any other plan would be too).
    - You can visit any provider without a referral. Therefore, if you want to meet with a specialist, for example a dermatologist, you can simply make an appointment without having to get a referral from your primary care provider.
    - Good if you see providers often</p>

<p><strong>POS</strong>
    - Usually considered a hybrid between a PPO and HMO cost and coverage wise. Out of network providers are covered but expensive.
    - Still often need a referral to see specialist providers 
    - Good if you want flexibility to go out of network but donâ€™t see a provider often.</p>
