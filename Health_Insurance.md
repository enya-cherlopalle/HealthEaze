YOUR RIGHTS IN ANY INSURANCE PLAN (as of jan 16, 2025)
Cant not give you insurance or increase your cost if you have a preexisting condition
Your employer must provide you an option for insurance if they have 50+ employees and you are full time. This means they pay a part of your premium, but you still have to pay a proportion. Typically these are more affordable and people pick these over a marketplace alternative.

### TYPES OF INSURANCE PLANS:
**HMO**
    - Typically a lower premium but higher deductible. Therefore you will have higher out of pocket expenses before you will get any coverage
    - NO out of network coverage. You must stay in network to get your care covered. This means it is important when picking a HMO to see that the providers you plan to visit are in network. Also take note of ER or Urgen cares that are close to you that are in network. 
    - If you want to see a specialist ( anyone other than a primary care provider) you must get a referral from your primary care provider.
    - Good if you rarely see providers and are able to only see in network providers.

**PPO**
    - Typically a higher premium but a lower deductible. Therefore you will have a high upfront cost but then get insurance coverage sooner. 
    - Has out of network coverage. Though often more expensive than in network, you will not have to pay for it completely out of pocket (unless you havent reached your deductible, like any other plan would be too).
    - You can visit any provider without a referral. Therefore, if you want to meet with a specialist, for example a dermatologist, you can simply make an appointment without having to get a referral from your primary care provider.
    - Good if you see providers often

**POS**
    - Usually considered a hybrid between a PPO and HMO cost and coverage wise. Out of network providers are covered but expensive.
    - Still often need a referral to see specialist providers 
    - Good if you want flexibility to go out of network but don't see a provider often.
